## Credits

[Breathly](https://github.com/mmazzarolo/breathly-app) was the greatest inspiration to this app. The features and interface are very similar, and the english lines are the same.

I bought the portuguese lines on fiverr.com. The female voice is from [Marlou Nobre](https://fiverr.com/marlou_nobre) and the male voice is still not available.
